# Menstrual-Cup-Mold

About us:

Welcome to The Crimson Wave Project! We are an organisation, a group of people, who are working to help address period poverty, 
while making sure we are as sustainable and eco-friendly as possible. 
Period poverty is when someone can’t access the period products they need, because they can’t afford it. 
This is a problem! In the UK, 1 in 10 people struggle with period poverty.
Our project is going to help resolve this issue making menstrual cups affordable or even freely available and distributing them to people who are in need. 
The sceam would possibly be that people who can afford the upfront cost can pay a little more to help those who can't. 
We want to iterate on the current menstrual cups, disks, applicators and other periode products that are on the market,
to optimise how they fit thus making them more comfortable and reliable. 
We are aiming to make our cups fully customisable, so that you can get the best experience possible.

We are gernerally quite flexible regarding our "buissness model" and are still evaluating what the best way would be of dooing things like on how and what to distribute,
either the finished product or even the moulds themselves everything is on the table.
Furthermore we want to inform people on menstruation related issued as well as some general helth aspects. 
Our aim is to connect people with these commen goals creating a community of makers making the next gerneration of menstrual products possible.

How can you get started with the project:
First of all if you have expirience coding or with openscad in particular checkout the files 
that are available, for now we only have a basic Menstrual cup design but that can change anytime.

current taskslist:
*documenting the design 

* restructuring the code (moving stuff to libraries, etc.)
* replace hardcoded values with documented parameters
* generalizing the mold generation (define the cup, autogenerate the mold).
