# Menstrual-Cup-Mold

Welcome to The Crimson Wave Project! We are an organisation, a group of people, who are working to help address period poverty in the UK, while making sure we are as sustainable and eco-friendly as possible. Period poverty is when someone can’t access the period products they need, because they can’t afford it. This is a problem for 1 in 10 people in the UK. Our project is hoping to help resolve this issue by 3D printing menstrual cups and distributing them at income-based prices. This will allow people who can’t afford the usual upfront cost of a menstrual cup to purchase one, and people who can afford the upfront cost can pay a little more and help people in future. We also recognise that while the currently available menstrual cups are great, they are far from perfect, particularly when it comes to how they fit. We are aiming to make our cups fully customisable, so that you can get the best experience possible.
